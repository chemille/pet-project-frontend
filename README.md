# Pet Project (frontend)

According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), an estimated 6.3 million companion animals (primarily dogs and cats) are admitted to animal shelters throughout the U.S. every year. Approximately 920,000 shelter animals are euthanized yearly.

This pet adoptions web application (ongoing project) was created with the thought of helping shelter animals get additional love and care from volunteers and increase the number of successful pet adoptions.
